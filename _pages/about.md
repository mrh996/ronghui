## 👨‍🏫 About Me
I am a **Lecturer (Assistant Professor)** in the Department of Computer Science at the **University of Exeter**.  

Previously, I worked as a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** in the *Trustworthy Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (TACPS) Lab* at the University of Liverpool, supervised by **Prof. Xiaowei Huang**.  

I obtained my **PhD in Artificial Intelligence** at Lancaster University, supervised by **Dr. Wenjie Ruan, Dr. Leandro Soriano Marcolino, and Prof. Qiang Ni**.  

My research focuses on the **robustness evaluation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**, including:  
- Safety testing for safety-critical systems  
- Adversarial attacks and defenses  
- Robustness verification  

I have conducted robustness analysis across multiple modalities: **image classifiers, video recognition models, 3D point cloud models, reinforcement learning**, and **large language models (LLMs)**.

## 🎯 Research Aims
- Advance the **robustness of deep learning systems**.  
- Develop methods for **safety testing, adversarial defense, and robustness verification** in AI, including images, videos, reinforcement learning, large language models, and multimodal systems.  
- Explore **cross-disciplinary applications** of reinforcement learning, including **protein design** and **electrical power systems**.
