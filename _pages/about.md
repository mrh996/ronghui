I am a PhD in Lancaster University. I am interested in the the improvement of robustness of Deep Neural Network, which includes safety testing for the DNN , adversarial attack on images and videos, and verification.  \\
My supervisors are Dr. Wenjie Ruan from Exeter University and Dr. Leandro Soriano Marcolino and Prof. Qiang Ni from Lancaster University
