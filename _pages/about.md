I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter. Prior to this I work as a PDRA at the University of Liverpool's Trustworthy Autonomous Cyber Physical Systems (TACPS) Lab. I obtained my PhD in artificatial inteligence at Lancaster University, supervised by Dr. Wenjie Ruan, Dr. Leandro Soriano Marcolino and Prof. Qiang Ni. My research focused on evaluation the robustness of Deep Neural Network, which includes safety testing for the DNN, adversarial attack, and robustness verification. I have conducted work on the robustness analysis of DNNs include image classifiers, videos recognisation models, 3D point cloud models, reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs).

Research Aims:
======
* My research vision is to improve the robustness of deep learning systems.
* My research focuses on the safety testing of deep learning networks for the safety-critical system, the adversarial attacks with its defenses and verification robustness

**I am currently recruiting new PhD candidates with interests in some of the following areas:**

* Safe, Secure and Explainable AI
* Probabilistic Verification
* Reinforcement Learning, NLP and Computer Vision
