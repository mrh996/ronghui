I am a PhD student in Lancaster University. I am interested in the the improvement of robustness of Deep Neural Network, which includes safety testing for the DNN , adversarial attack on images and videos, and robustness verification.  \\
My supervisors are Dr. Wenjie Ruan from Exeter University and Dr. Leandro Soriano Marcolino and Prof. Qiang Ni from Lancaster University

Research Aims:
======
* My research vision is to improve the robustness of deep learning systems.
* My research focuses on the safety testing of deep learning networks for the safety-critical system, the adversarial attacks with its defenses and verification robustness.
